# Build a WhiteList Frontend DApp.

This project demonstrates a basic Whitelisting use case. Let's say you are launching your NFT project and you want to give exclsuive access to a whitelist. You can use the smart contract to create your whitelist and the frontend for users to join the whitelist

Check out the [main](https://github.com/masiedu4/whitelist-smart-contract-solidity-/tree/main) branch for the smart part of this project. (Built and deployed with Solidity and Hardhat)
